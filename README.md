Client Side JSON methods 
 - JSON.stringy(<some-data>): helps us to turn some data into JSON, before it gets sent in a Fetch request
 - response.json(): helps us turn some JSON into normal JS (async)

 Backend
 - res.json(<some-data>): helps us to turn some data into JSON before it gets send in a RESPONSE, e.g. as a response to a fetch request (async)

 Both Environments
 - JSON.parse(<some-data>): helps us to turn some JSON data into normal JS (synchronously)
